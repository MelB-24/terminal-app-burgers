## First updates ##

Wednesday 4th September 11.00am

My first day of coding my app went quite well. I have finished coding all the menu choices, so the user can go through and select all the ingredients they would like in their burger. My next step is to add to the case statements so that as an ingredient is added to the burger, the cost is added as well. After this I would like to add the ASCII art where at the end it prints out the picture of the burger. My biggest struggle at the moment is that the main coding file I am working on won't pick up the array in a seperate file which has all the costs hard coded. I wanted to do this so that my main file is a lot cleaner and doesn't have huge slabs of information everywhere. 


## Second Update ##

Thursday 5th September 9:15am

Yesterday I was able to complete all of the main coding I wanted to for my app. This included fixing all the bugs that I can find at the moment (I'm sure a user will find more). Today my main focus to just do all the documentation that is needed for the end product. Once I have got all this done I will attempt to fiddle around with the code and see if I can add any more features.
